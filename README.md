* One-Hit Kill 🗡️
* Unlimited Items & Resources 🧱
* Mega XP Boost 📈
* Instant Taming 🐲
* Freeze AI 🤖
* No Clip Mode (fly through walls) ✈️
* Day/Night Control 🌞🌚

## Why Use a Trainer Instead of Other Mods?

Mods are cool, but they’re bulky, messy, and often buggy AF. Trainers, on the other hand, are lightweight, plug-and-play tools with zero setup stress. Here's how the ARK Trainer stands out:

| Feature              | ARK Trainer        | Traditional Mods |
| -------------------- | ------------------ | ---------------- |
| Easy Activation      | ✅ One click        | ❌ Manual setup   |
| Performance Impact   | ⚡ Low              | 🐌 Often Laggy   |
| Risk of Bugs         | 🚫 Minimal         | 🐞 High          |
| Game Updates Support | 🔁 Regular updates | ❌ Often outdated |
| No Install Required  | ✅ Portable         | ❌ Folder clutter |
